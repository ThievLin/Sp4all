										<h5><span>History</span></h5>
										<p>During the 1960s-1970s, O’ Nglav Protected Area’s community forest flourished with diverse wildlife and valuable trees. However, deforestation by newcomers gradually caused its disappearance from 1970-1990. The influx of migrants exacerbated the issue, leading to illegal logging, housing construction, and firewood extraction. In 2008, with support from Po Chrey commune authorities, the provincial environment department, and NGOs, the villagers of Pu Chrey commune initiated the establishment of the Trapeang Keum Protected Area community. This initiative aimed to involve local people and resource users in the sustainable management, protection, and utilization of the area, addressing the imminent threat to forest resources. <br>
											<br><strong>This community is recognized and approved by :</strong>
											<br><strong><i class="fa fa-arrow-right"></i>&nbsp;&nbsp;</strong> Prakas of Recognition No. 494, dated 28 November 2017, by the Ministry of Environment.
											<br><strong><i class="fa fa-arrow-right"></i>&nbsp;&nbsp;</strong> Since 2018, supported by the ACCESS project funded by WWW/EU and implemented by My Village (MVi) and the Sre Pok Wildlife Sanctuary.
											<br><strong><i class="fa fa-arrow-right"></i>&nbsp;&nbsp;</strong> In 2022, supported by the P-CAIP project funded by Oxfam and coordinated by My Village.
