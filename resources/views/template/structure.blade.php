                                <div class="entry excerpt">
                                    <p>The structure of the SP4ALL coalition consists of chairperson and deputy chairperson, a core group, the secretariat, and the general members. The purpose, roles and responsibilities are listed below:
                                    </p>
                                    <p>sed quia consequuntur magni dolores eos qui ratione voluptatem sequi nesciunt. Neque porro quisquam est, qui dolorem ipsum quia dolor sit amet, consectetur, adipisci velit, sed quia non numquam eius modi tempora incidunt</p>
                                    <h4 style="color: orange;">1. Leadership</h4>
                                    <p>In the leadership structure, the Chairperson and Deputy Chairperson play crucial roles. Their responsibilities encompass not only overseeing the coalition's functions but also representing it at various levels. Furthermore, they hold a significant say in the decision-making process, ensuring that the coalition's objectives and strategies are effectively implemented.</p>
                                    <h4 style="color: orange;">2. Core Group</h4>
                                    <p>The Core Group is pivotal to our organization's effective functioning and direction. Its primary objective is to support and steer the strategic initiatives, ensuring that our mission is consistently achieved. This group is comprised of select individuals who meet specific membership criteria, often entailing prior experience or an association with participating organizations and unions. The mandate for membership in the Core Group requires a commitment to a minimum of two years.</p>
                                    <p> Members of the Core Group have distinct roles and responsibilities. They are tasked with defining the coalition's administrative structure, setting strategic directions, ensuring the coalition's effectiveness, and providing valuable technical support on policy matters. The expertise required from these members encompasses strong communication skills, a deep understanding of the social protection system, and an aptitude for negotiation.</p>
                                    <p> For a balanced and efficient functioning, there's a structured process for selecting members to the Core Group. Interested members from Civil Society Organisations, trade unions, and other representative groups can express their interest to join. Their applications are diligently reviewed by existing members and require an endorsement from the Chairperson. Similarly, if a member's alignment or activity wanes, discussions are held to determine their continued involvement. Persistent inactivity or divergence from the coalition's objectives may result in termination from the Core Group.</p>
                                    <p> In terms of decision-making and governance, the Core Group adheres to a consensus-based approach. Most decisions require a majority (50+1) consensus. In situations where a unanimous agreement isn't reached, the final call is made by the Chairperson or Deputy Chairperson in consultation with the Core Group members. This structure ensures that all decisions are made in the best interest of the coalition and its mission.
                                    </p>
                                    <h4 style="color: orange;">3. Secretariat</h4>
                                    <p>The Secretariat stands as a vital support system for the coalition, ensuring smooth day-to-day operations and coordination for the SP4ALL Coalition. As of now, Oxfam has graciously taken on the role of the Secretariat for the fiscal years 2022-2023, a decision endorsed by the leadership and core members of our coalition.</p>
                                    <p> The roles and responsibilities of the Secretariat are multifaceted. They are tasked with providing both administrative and logistical support for the various meetings, events, and workshops organized by the coalition, always ensuring that the objectives of the coalition are met and upheld. As agents of constructive engagement, the Secretariat liaises with relevant government institutions, solidifying the coalition's position and representation. Their duties also include serving as the main focal point for the SP4ALL's coordinated advocacy efforts with governmental bodies and development partners.</p>
                                     <p> Additionally, the Secretariat ensures all meetings are inclusive, encouraging input from all members and making certain that decisions or recommendations are collectively agreed upon. A significant aspect of their role is monitoring the coalition's progress, tracking milestones, and overseeing the SP4ALL coalition's website and other media channels. They are also responsible for creating and disseminating meeting minutes and annual reports that align with the coalition's vision and mandate. Through their unwavering commitment, the Secretariat plays a pivotal role in the coalition's success and growth.</p>
                                    <h4 style="color: orange;">4. General Membership</h4>
                                    <p>The General Membership forms the backbone of the SP4ALL Coalition, comprising dedicated members who share a common passion and vision for an inclusive and transformative social protection system. These members, hailing from a variety of backgrounds including CSOs, trade unions, and associations, contribute richly to the coalition's endeavors.</p>
                                    <p> For those interested in joining the coalition as a General Member, the process is straightforward yet vital for maintaining the integrity and mission of SP4ALL. Organizations and individuals wishing to become a part of our coalition need to express their interest by filling in a designated application form. This application undergoes a thorough review by the core group and the leadership of the coalition before approval.</p>
                                    <p> As members, the roles and responsibilities they shoulder are significant. They are actively involved in meetings, workshops, conferences, research presentations, and various ad hoc events organized by the coalition. Additionally, they lend their support to advocacy actions, campaigns, and provide invaluable expertise to further the mission of SP4ALL. Their input and policy recommendations on various research topics, policy briefs, and position papers play a pivotal role in influencing policy outcomes. Members also collaborate with fellow members to identify opportunities for resource mobilization, joint ventures, and shared capacity-building initiatives.</p>
                                    <p> To ensure that our General Membership remains robust and aligned with the coalition's objectives, there are specific criteria for selection. Potential members should ideally be registered with the Ministry of Interior or other relevant ministries. Alternatively, they should possess well-defined organizational and leadership structures. It's imperative that they have experience in, or a genuine interest in, social protection-related work to enrich the coalition's collective expertise.</p>
