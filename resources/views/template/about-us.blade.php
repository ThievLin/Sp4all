                        <h2 style="color: orange; font-size: 25px;">Who We Are ?</h2>
                        <p>The SP4ALL Coalition stands as a beacon for social protection in Cambodia. We are a proud Civil Society Organization (CSO)-led coalition formed with the unified goal of elevating the awareness of social protection among our fellow citizens. At the crossroads of policy and community, SP4ALL bridges the gap, ensuring the voices of the everyday Cambodian reach the corridors of power.</p>
                        <br>
                        <h2 style="color: orange; font-size: 25px;">Our Origins</h2>
                        <p>Our journey began with a shared vision among various Civil Society Organizations (CSOs) in Cambodia. We recognized the growing need to educate and share knowledge around critical social protection topics. As a collective, we are strengthened by diversity, pooling resources, insights, and experiences from various segments of our society, from workers to youth groups, Trade Unions to workers associations, and particularly from individuals with disabilities and the Indigenous community.</p>

                    <p>At our core, we strive to be the voice for every Cambodian citizen. SP4ALL is dedicated to representing their demands in policy development, facilitating the transfer of knowledge, and promoting synergies for a robust, inclusive, and gender-transformative social protection system. Our efforts are not limited to national borders; we envision creating ripples of change that resonate both nationally and regionally.</p>

                    <h2 style="color: orange; font-size: 25px;">Our Commitment</h2>
                    <p>Beyond just being a voice, SP4ALL is an active movement. We are on the frontlines, pushing for tangible policy changes that can reshape futures. Our coalition serves as a dynamic space where members unite to discuss ideas, dissect policies, strategize, and collectively draft a blueprint for a brighter tomorrow.</p>
